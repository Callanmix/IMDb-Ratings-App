### Problem:
My wife and I wanted a new show, but we had some bad luck with shows that started good, but ended poorly. I wanted a way to simply show how a show averaged over time. 


### Answer:
A python flask app that gathers show ratings and visualizes them. Click the link below to access. The server may need 30 seconds to boot up.


### How to Use:
Enter the name of a show. Verify that show and then see its IMDb scores for every episode plotted out. This helps you to see if a show is worth your time and if it goes up or down in quality over time.
